# AirlineSafety

This project focused on playing the role of a business analyst for a major US airliner. Five unique means of data visualization were created to promote the message of airline safety - a blog post, a powerpoint presentation, a Tableau dashboard, an infographic, and a short video for social media. Tableau and PowerPoint were the primary tools used in this project.
